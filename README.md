# BAN6420-Final-Project-Flask-Healthcare-Application

As a Python developer working for a data analysis company in Washington, DC, I have been assigned the task of developing a survey tool for collecting participants' data.

The objective is to analyze their income spending in preparation for a new product launch in the healthcare industry.

In this final project assignment, you are required to:

Create a simple webpage using Flask to collect user data.

Store user details, including Age, Gender, Total Income, and Expenses, in MongoDB.

Use checkboxes for expense categories (utilities, entertainment, school fees, shopping, healthcare), each with a corresponding textbox to insert amounts spent.

Create a Python or R class named "User."

Loop through the collected data and store it in a CSV file.

Load the CSV file into a Jupyter notebook.
